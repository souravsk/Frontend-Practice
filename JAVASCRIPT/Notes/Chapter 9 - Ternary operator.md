# Chapter 9 - Ternary Operator

A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.

Its syntax is:

```
condition ? expression1 : expression2
```

The ternary operator evaluates the test condition.

- If the condition is `true`, **expression1** is executed.
- If the condition is `false`, **expression2** is executed.

The ternary operator takes **three** operands, hence, the name ternary operator. It is also known as a conditional operator.
