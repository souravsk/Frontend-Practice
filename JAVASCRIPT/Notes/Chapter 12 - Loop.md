# Chapter 12 - Loops

# while loop

In the while loop, we provide a condition and the loop will run until the condition get a break

```jsx
let mynumber = 1;
while (mynumber < 50){
	mynumber++;
	console.log(mynumber)
{
```

# do while loop

the only difference from while is that it will at least exist even if the condition doesnâ€™t even satisfy once.  

```jsx
let mynumber = 1;
do{
	console.log(myname)
}
while (mynumber < 50){
	mynumber++;
	console.log(mynumber)
{
```

# for loop

In for loop we have 3 sections first is the relation of the variable, then the condition and the incremation.

```jsx
for(let i = 1; i < 100; i++){
	console.log(i)
}
```

it is the most used loop in any or every programming language
